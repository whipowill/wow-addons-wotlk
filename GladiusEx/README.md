# GladiusEx - WotLK

The famous (and imo, far superior) arena frame AddOn GladiusEx - now for WotLK!

## Installing

The folder "GladiusExBackport-WotLK-master must be renamed to "GladiusEx" and placed in /Interface/AddOns (relative the WoW root folder).

### Note

The "Incoming" Absorb/Heal portion of the healthbar module has been removed as the underlying API is non-existant in WotLK.

The "Cooldowns" module is only in alpha/experimental mode. Please report any bugs, but usage is at your own risk.

### Disclaimer

The backport has not been widely tested and may contain serious bugs, if you choose to use the AddOn and find any such bugs please report them to me by creating an "issue" at https://github.com/ManneN1/GladiusExBackport-WotLK/issues/new.

What little testing has been done, was performed on "Virtus" Instant 80 PvP Realm.
